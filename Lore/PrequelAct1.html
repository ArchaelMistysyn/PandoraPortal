<h1>Our Beginning</h1>
<p>
  My sister and I were born within the twilight, in a crack in the divine
  mirror where beginnings die and endings are born. I remember the moment I
  came to be. I remember the cold, and air thick with ash and lightning. I
  remember my parents: My mother Tiamat in her primordial, monstrous form.
  My father Alaric, his voice like falling embers and his aura shimmering
  like a rising sun. Above all, I remember my sister Pandora, who had
  precious stars for eyes and a radiant soul. Brighter than Alaric’s, hers
  was a brilliance too blinding to bear. I winced, unable to shield my
  newborn eyes, until mother’s wing enveloped me, veiling the harsh light
  in an empty, safe darkness.
</p>

<p>
  But let me begin where all things should: the origin, before it all fell
  apart.
</p>

<h1>Descent of the Dragon Queen</h1>
<p>
  Long before I came to be, Tiamat fell from a rift in the heavens, a huge
  tear in the sky’s fabric. She was not of this earth. She was a Ruler like
  Alaric, but she came from a land far more ancient and cruel. She had ten
  heads, each crowned with crystalline horns, and a coiled body clad in
  jagged, metallic scales. Her wings radiated frost, with ice so pure it
  burned.
</p>

<p>
  She descended from the heavens, wreathed in a storm of fury.
</p>

<p>
  Alaric was peace, the Ruler of Totality, order incarnate, radiant with
  gold yet tempered by stillness. He could assume a human form, regal and
  stoic, untouched by entropy. He greeted Tiamat with both suspicion and
  reverence.
</p>

<p>
  But power bows before beauty, and she wore seduction like armour. Their
  love was not love, but hunger.
</p>

<h1>A Twisted Love</h1>
<p>
  Tiamat spoke in malevolent tongues and ruinous words older than our stars.
  Her ice flames danced, flickering in the firmament while whispering
  shadowed secrets into Alaric’s dreams. Though a being of unwavering
  balance, our father allowed himself to embrace this forbidden love. He
  welcomed her into his realm, his trust, his temple. And slowly, secretly,
  she siphoned him, draining his sacred power, the force of creation itself.
</p>

<p>
  From that thievery, we were born under shattered skies and howling storms.
  Pandora came first, wailing like the breaking dawn. I followed. Quiet,
  wide-eyed in awe, as if I could sense her soul’s radiance.
</p>

<p>
  Pandora received Alaric's gift of genesis, while I was given Tiamat’s
  curse of terminus. Thus, our destinies were set: One blessed, one
  forsaken.
</p>

<h1>Before the Fall</h1>
<p>
  We grew quickly. For us, time moved like light skimming across water. One
  moment we were infants, the next we were children dancing in the embers
  of collapsing stars. Pandora, ever warm and gentle, forever gazed skyward
  toward the empyrean, toward hope. My gaze dwelled in her shadow for even
  her darkness was warm and comforting.
</p>

<p>
  She held my hand once, saying, “Look up, Thana. I want you to look at
  me.” And for the first time, I saw her clear, beautiful soul.
</p>

<p>
  Mother kept us close. Her ten heads hissed lullabies sweetened with
  soothing lies. Her wings wrapped around us, possessive and smothering. She
  loved us the way fire loves wood: passionately, selfishly.
</p>

<p>
  Father watched from afar. He smiled softly at Tiamat, his love, and
  Pandora, his treasure. He never looked my way, but out of fear, not
  cruelty. I don’t blame him.
</p>

<p>
  Pandora’s soul was purer than Father’s, but mine was darker than Mother’s.
</p>

<h1>The Dream Splintered</h1>
<p>
  It began with a vision that was hers, but also mine. We were more than
  sisters. We were soul-bound, sensing each other’s happiness and pain. Thus
  I saw it through her eyes: A world in ruin, the sky torn asunder, stars
  engulfed by cursed flame, Mother devouring the heavens, and my hands
  ashen, trembling with a power I couldn't control.
</p>

<p>
  I awoke crying and screaming. In an instant Pandora was there, her small
  arms around me, squeezing me softly in her gentle embrace. “You’re safe,”
  she whispered. “It was just a dream.” But it wasn’t. I could see Mother's
  corrupt soul, the way it dripped with sin. I said nothing, but we both
  knew the truth of our vision.
</p>

<h1>The Death of Me</h1>
<p>
  I wish I could say I made the right decision that day. The truth is that I
  couldn’t decide at all. I covered my ears and shut my eyes, letting my
  sister fight our battle alone.
</p>

<p>
  From Father’s reliquary, she took his sacred Hammer, a treasure second
  only to his prized eldest daughter. It held unfathomable power far beyond
  what Pandora could handle as a child. Maybe if we’d gone together, things
  could’ve been different.
</p>

<p>
  But she stood alone before Tiamat. A single light defying the abyss.
  Panicked, I ran to Father and told him everything. I’ll never forget the
  overwhelming rage in his eyes, nor the bliss I felt as he cast his furious
  gaze upon me. It was the first and last time our eyes truly met, and the
  last thing I remember before he lashed out.
</p>

<p>Mine was a swift death.</p>

<h1>The Fall</h1>
<p>
  Pandora wielded the Hammer, tearing her soul and shattering the heavens as
  she struck Tiamat. It was foolish of my sister to think she could bear the
  crushing weight, and I cannot begin to fathom how she must have felt at
  that moment. I imagine it as an unravelling, her essence folding inwards
  on itself, her threads screaming as her soul ripped apart.
</p>

<p>
  Tiamat took the full impact. Perhaps she shielded Pandora from some of the
  backlash. I want to believe that she did. The blow was devastating, but
  she would survive. Things were dire, but even so the damage could still be
  undone. Instead, our mother made the most unforgivable choice. She turned
  her back on my sister, her own daughter, splitting apart in front of her.
  She ran.
</p>

<p><strong>Act I End.</strong></p>
