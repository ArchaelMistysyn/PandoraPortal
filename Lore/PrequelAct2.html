<h1>When the Light Broke</h1>
<p>
  I remember it vividly, my clearest memory. I still feel the ripples of
  that moment. In the silence that followed, the explosive sound
  reverberated through me. I shattered, but from something deeper than
  pain: something sacred, as if the universe itself recoiled from what I
  had done.
</p>

<p>
  I was born a bearer of genesis, the daughter of stars. But the moment I
  wielded the Celestial Hammer, my soul split. This transcends memory. I
  can still feel the rupture as I recall that moment. It felt as though my
  body folded outward like a starflower blooming in reverse, petals of my
  essence scattering across the void. Each fragment carried a part of me:
  my light, my darkness, my hope, my love, leaving behind only a single
  thread of the original tapestry.
</p>

<h1>The Rise of the Paragons</h1>
<p>
  From those scattered threads the Paragons were born, forged from the
  petals of my essence. They were the splinters of a soul torn open. I did
  not name them, and yet, I knew them.
</p>

<p>
  Some felt close and familiar: Eleuia, who wept in despair over the wishes
  I could no longer realize. Alaya, who shouldered the heavy past I no
  longer called my own. Kama, who loved those I no longer could. Each looked
  at me with feelings I dared not return.
</p>

<p>
  Others felt distant and estranged. Akasha, endless as the furthest
  expanse of space. Oblivia, empty as a black starless sky. Aria, who
  embodied the end of all things.
</p>

<p>
  They all carried pieces of me I could no longer claim.
</p>

<h1>The Garden of Wounds</h1>
<p>
  We lived in the Celestial Cradle, a realm carved from shattered dreams
  and star-forged regret. They called me Pandora, yet the name felt hollow.
  What does it mean to be the source, when the source is now just a shard?
  I could not remember how it felt to be whole. Perhaps I never will.
</p>

<p>
  There were times I woke with the illusion that I was still her—the one who
  wielded a hammer smoldering with stardust. But then I would speak, and the
  words fell to nothing. I couldn’t tell anymore if this voice was mine. I
  would wash my face in the celestial waters to clear my mind, but couldn’t
  recognize the reflection when the water stilled.
</p>

<p>
  My reflection accused me in silence. Her whispers were my own. My soul
  burned like fire on half an altar, my memories drifting away in the smoke.
</p>

<h1>That Which Remained</h1>
<p>
  “Thana”. I spoke the unfamiliar name often, pondering its meaning while
  cherishing the sound. It stirred strange feelings of pain and longing,
  and yet, in those dark times, it was my only comfort. I know now what she
  thought of herself back then, but to me, it was she who shone the
  brightest. Perhaps I knew all along, but could not bear to let go. Even
  with our connection severed, you will always be irreplaceable.
</p>

<p>
  My beloved sister.
</p>

<p>
  Every time I hold the Celestial Hammer, I feel it tremble in my hand. I
  dare not use both. Not because I lack the power or control, but because I
  fear what piece of myself it will destroy next. How many more times can I
  swing it until nothing remains?
