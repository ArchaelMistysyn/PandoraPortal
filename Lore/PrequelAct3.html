<h1>The Error at the Beginning</h1>
<p>
  They say the world began in harmony. They lie. I am Vexia, an Arbiter, and
  I say it began in error. There was no design, only deviation. I did not
  walk among the first ones, those who tore the heavens and shattered time,
  though I have stood at the borders of what they left behind. I have read
  what they tried to erase. I have felt Alaric’s regret lingering like ash
  in sanctified air, and I know the truth others wish to forget.
</p>

<h1>The Wrath of Rulers</h1>
<p>
  By the time Tiamat’s betrayal was revealed, it was already too late. She
  had gone beyond stealing Alaric’s sacred power to shake the harmony of
  balance itself. Their final confrontation tore across the skies of the
  sacred plane. Tiamat, desperate and wild, unleashed chaos and destruction
  while Alaric, adorned with golden armour, tore through the entropy.
</p>

<p>
  The sacred blade of law he once wielded was now tainted with wrath. Not
  retribution, but revenge. Not exile, but execution. Neck by neck, he
  mercilessly struck down eight of her heads. Breaking free, she fled,
  vanishing into the abyss of broken dimensions whence she came, wounded but
  whispering of return. Not a victory, but a curse.
</p>

<h1>The Arbiters of the Divine Lotus</h1>
<p>
  Alaric sat in silence for seven days. When he stirred again, it was not as
  the Ruler of Totality, but as a man who had broken the very law he
  embodied. The eight severed heads of Tiamat lay beside him, bleeding
  promise and poison under the scarred sky.
</p>

<p>
  From each head, he forged an Arbiter embodied with a different aspect of
  his power. We represented both atonement and promise. We were the watchers
  maintaining law and stability, quietly holding the aching sky together. I
  knew the truth, that he had abandoned his ideals for his daughters because
  he feared the world could no longer support them. His many
  transgressions—I was the one who erased them from the records.
</p>

<p>
  Beneath the ruins of his sanctum, Alaric crafted a realm beyond time: a
  new sanctuary woven from memory and possibility. He created the Divine
  Lotus, suspended on petals of eternity, to restore the veil and uphold the
  divine laws. But he should have stopped there, before he crossed the line.
</p>

<h1>The First Resurrection</h1>
<p>
  Alaric stood in the crater where Thana lay, no longer averting his eyes
  from her cold, charred body. He carried her lifeless form to the Divine
  Lotus in his trembling arms. One Arbiter foolishly dared to stop him. That
  eighth Arbiter no longer exists—unnamed and unwritten in an instant.
</p>

<p>
  Within the Divine Lotus, he solemnly held Thana close and expended his
  sacred energy, violating the laws he had just woven. His essence merged
  and became one with the Divine Lotus in an act of rebellion that would
  unmake finality. The Samsara, a wheel of death and rebirth, would be his
  gift to the living. He left only one command, “Let them find their way.
  Without me.” One day he may awaken from his slumber, but he will never
  again wield the sacred power. How long can our realm truly last without a
  Ruler?
</p>

<p>
  Thana rose, serene and renewed, to stand over Alaric’s unconscious form.
  She looked down at his motionless eyes. “You old fool.”
</p>

<h1>The Weight We Carry</h1>
<p>
  And so we the Arbiters watch over the planes. We tend the Divine Lotus,
  yet dare not glimpse into the Samsara due to the horrors it holds. Thana
  roams calmly through endings that are yet to begin, guiding lost souls to
  find their way back home. Her existence is unfathomable and inadmissible,
  yet we overlook this violation as we do our own. The once sacred laws have
  become twisted and corrupt.
</p>

<p>
  I sometimes wonder if he still dreams. If he senses Tiamat drifting beyond
  this realm. If he sees Pandora piecing herself back together. If he sees
  Thana walking alone, bearing the burden he left behind. And I wonder if he
  regrets loving the dragon.
