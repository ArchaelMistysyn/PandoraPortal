<h1>When Harmony Cracked</h1>
<p>
  We were not meant to fight, but I remember the day the stars turned
  against each other. Neither thunder nor fire heralded war, but whispers.
  Promises spoken softly through the Divine Lotus. Promises of peace.
  Promises of healing. Promises that fractured us.
</p>

<p>
  We the Paragons, born of Pandora’s shattering, were many and different. We
  were not made to obey. We were made to be. We coexisted as fragments in
  fragile unity. The Arbiters, sculpted from Alaric’s grief and Tiamat’s
  remains, masked duplicitous intentions buried under flowery words. Their
  judgment cast long shadows across our freedom. We have never walked
  alongside each other as they governed structure while we sought freedom.
</p>

<p>
  We called it oppression. And the divide became a chasm. The first war.
</p>

<h1>Pandora’s Box</h1>
<p>
  Pandora, our beginning, longed to be whole again. Still broken, still
  lost. And the Arbiters circled the scent of blood like wolves. Beneath the
  Divine Lotus, they fed her lies and false promises laced with feigned
  sympathy.
</p>

<p>
  'You are incomplete,' they told her. 'We can restore what you once were.'
  And she believed them. They gave her that dreadful box, a vessel capable
  of sealing even the divine. She returned to us, her Paragons, and asked us
  to lay down our shields. Some pleaded. Some rebelled. But me? I cried.
</p>

<p>
  She raised her Hammer. No longer the unsteady child who had wildly struck
  Tiamat, she now wielded it with intent and control. One by one, she sealed
  us in that box. She couldn’t understand us, but we understood her. Despite
  our individual feelings, we knew she was not to blame. Our echoes followed
  her, trying to convince her, but in doing so we only added to the voices
  that tormented her.
</p>

<h1>A Sister’s Bond</h1>
<p>
  Oblivia and Akasha were two Paragons endowed like myself with boundless
  abilities, yet paling in comparison to that Hammer of higher existence.
  Pandora sealed Akasha, while Oblivia vanished, escaped into the abyssal
  plane. That domain and the Paragon Rua, both born of Pandora’s own
  darkness, were now the very things that kept her at bay. She could not
  breach that bottomless chasm on her own. I truly believed she might
  finally give up this misguided hunt.
</p>

<p>
  But Thana was watching too, and she saw what her sister had become and
  would come to be. The great light she had once admired now flickered
  dimly. She approached her sister as a stranger, an unknown wanderer.
</p>

<p>‘Do you know who I am?’</p>

<p>
  Pandora didn’t answer. Did not utter the name that had once brought her
  comfort for she could no longer remember. Despite not knowing, there was
  an unspoken, instinctual trust. Thana took the box from her shaking hands
  and led a golden legion of undead from the Samsara into the abyss,
  returning with the sealed Paragons.
</p>

<p>
  Before leaving, she asked Pandora, ‘Pitiful soul, is this really what you
  want?' I knew no answer would be forthcoming. I was her desire, her wish.
  It was my fault, for my very existence stole from her those feelings she
  so desperately needed. I watched from afar as Thana returned the box, but
  she did not return to the Samsara right away. Instead, she came to me.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Pandora, It was you I was asking. Think about it carefully. Don’t make
  the same mistakes that I once did, dear sister.’ It felt strange to be
  called by that name, but I think Thana was the only one who saw us for
  what we really were. Then, without hesitation, she reached out and hugged
  me. That was the first time I remember crying.
</p>

<h1>A Defiled Wish</h1>
<p>
  Frozen with despair for so long, I forgot that I was the one who could
  change things, the only one who could show Pandora what she’d lost. I
  should’ve gone to her, become her hope. Instead I sought to end things at
  the source, so I took the fight to the Arbiters. I thought I could solve
  everything with my wish-granting ability, but I understood neither their
  power, nor my limits. I was powerless against them. I ran to her as she
  arrived—the first me—reaching for the hand that once was my own.
</p>

<p>
  'It’s not your fault,' I said. 'Come back.' But it was too late. She
  pushed me away and drew her Hammer. They watched us with their voracious
  eyes. The hammer struck first, then recognition. Wide-eyed, I wished her
  Hammer someplace else. But they never feared me. They feared that weapon.
  They poisoned us against each other, using me to take it away from her.
  Before I could wish it back, they were upon us. That was the last thing I
  remember before we were both sealed.
</p>

<p>
  Yubelle, the Adjudicator, Arbiter of Judgement, led the Arbiters into the
  Samsara to confront Thana. Outnumbered by the golden legion, Yubelle made
  her way through the hellish battlefield and stood alone against Thana. The
  two clashed amidst a war of blood and bones. Thana already knew the
  outcome, not only of this war, but also of the one to follow. A future
  that even Fleur, the Oracle, Arbiter of Prophecy, could not foresee.
  Overcome by divine lightning, Thana was defeated and sealed alongside her
  fragmented sister. With the war ended, the box was hidden in the mortal
  plane and lost to time. Echoes of Thana’s last words lingered in the air
  alongside the scent of death.
