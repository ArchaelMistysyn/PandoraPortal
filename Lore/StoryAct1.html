<h1>Act I – The Mortal Journey</h1>

<h1>The First Blessing</h1>
<p>
The last snow of the year still lies on the Eulorian fields  
when the Hero first experiences the voice of Veritas.  
It speaks with the sound of nameless, forbidden colors—  
frosted reds, ashen blues, ivory blacks, and obsidian whites.  
It catches the Hero in the silence between heartbeats  
to utter a single truth:  
"You were born to mend what the false gods have broken."
</p>

<p>
A cage of eyes entraps the Hero,  
weaving around the Hero's skin before erupting in sacred flames.  
The fire soon dissipates and the colours speak clearly:  
“A blessing from beyond, for the chosen from within.  
We will guide your way.”
</p>


<h1>A Hopeless Wish</h1>
<p>
Led by that opalescent voice,  
the Hero journeys past Euloria to the ruined temple of ancients,  
where half-buried murals depict malevolent spirits  
being sealed within Pandora's Box.  
Fearlessly navigating the trapped corridors,  
the Hero reaches the hidden chambers.  
The secret sanctuary is filled with briar vines and dust,  
but when the Hero's hand, aglow with Veritas's mark,  
touches the lid, ten thousand seals unroll like petals.  
Walls shake, shadows ripple,  
and the opened time-worn coffer releases screams older than the moon.  
Souls pour out as the binding chains melt away.
</p>

<p>
Before terror can take root,  
it is dispelled by the manifestation of prismatic wings.  
Eleuia, the Wish, hovers above the debris,  
her chromatic tears staining the rubble.  
"Tell me, Hero, what is it that you wish for?" she asks,  
her voice incandescent with grief.  
She touches two fingers of light to the Hero’s brow, imparting a second blessing.  
"I can see it, even if you cannot.  
I give this wish to you as thanks, though I fear it is wasted.  
Find me and show me I was wrong."  
The room empties and the color fades to black.  
A lone maiden remains.
</p>


<h1>The Maiden & The Box</h1>
<p>
That evening, starlight spills across the ruins,  
and the Hero feels a pull—subtle yet firm—  
the draw of the endless Celestia.  
There, amidst the ancient stone and the celestial glow,  
sits Pandora, her robes flowing like the astral winds.  
The Celestial Hammer lies beside her, still and silent,  
as though waiting.  
Her eyes, like swirling constellations,  
fix on the Hero with a flicker of understanding.
</p>

<p>
"I sense something... familiar," she says,  
her voice low but not without weight.  
"A mark, a blessing perhaps, though I cannot say from where it comes.  
A trespasser’s gift."
</p>

<p>
Pandora’s gaze lingers on the opened Box resting at her feet.  
She gestures toward it.  
"Take it, Hero.  
Assist me in sealing the contents back inside,  
and in return I will bestow upon you the power of the stars.  
The Paragons have been freed,  
and their power now stirs.  
They must be bound to this box once more,  
to reclaim these pieces of my original self."
</p>

<p>
She holds the Hero’s gaze, her celestial eyes searching,  
as if trying to read what lies are hidden within them.  
Though she does not know of Veritas,  
there is an undeniable sense that the Hero's presence here is no accident.  
It is not yet clear whether they are allies,  
or perhaps something more,  
but in that moment, Pandora knows they are bound together by something far greater.
</p>


<h1>The Mortal Plane</h1>
<p>
Pandora tells the Hero of Aurora,  
one of those three shards too weak to return to the Celestial Plane.  
These False Paragons are seeking to regain their strength  
by gathering the stones infused with Pandora’s original energy.  
The Hero, alongside Pandora, storms the fortress where they encounter Aurora.  
His once resplendent wings have dimmed to a muted luster.  
Though his power is merely a fragment of what it once was,  
Aurora refuses to lay down his arms.  
They clash, the sound reverberating through the fortress  
as Aurora’s towering shield collapses under the Hero's relentless assault.
</p>

<p>
As Aurora begins to fade,  
he gazes up at Pandora with a mixture of defiance and weary understanding.  
"You think sealing us will make you whole again, sister," he murmurs.  
His essence dims as it is drawn into the Box.  
"Find another way.  
This path will only leave you more broken than before."  
With those final words, Aurora is gone.
</p>


<h1>A Starry Refuge & The Encounter with Thana</h1>
<p>
After the Hero’s victory over Aurora,  
Pandora leads them to her celestial sanctuary,  
a hidden refuge amidst the vast reaches of shattered nebulae.  
This sanctuary is not a place of wandering souls,  
but a forge and home,  
a space where Pandora can recuperate and create.  
It is here, amidst the cosmic quiet,  
that she forges the hero’s weapons,  
refines his armour,  
and offers guidance towards strength and spirit.
</p>

<p>
When Pandora departs briefly to attend to matters of celestial importance,  
the Hero is surprised by the sudden emergence of Thana, the Paragon of Death.  
She emerges from the shadows, serene yet imposing,  
adorned in glistening armour forged from frozen starlight and celestial marrow.  
Her aura radiates the quiet inevitability of death,  
as it slowly devours the threads of life around her.  
She grants the Hero a calm and knowing gaze and speaks:
</p>

<p>
"Endings do not seek you."  
Her voice carries the gravity of inevitability,  
"but you will meet them, as all must.  
Continue helping my sister, and I promise you this:  
no matter how many endings you find,  
I will guide you back to her side.”  
She allows a moment before shifting to a more threatening tone,  
“The one path is many.  
And yet, at the end of every divergence the outcome is unchanging.  
If you stray beyond the path,  
I shall be the last ending you find."
</p>

<p>
Her words linger as a promise of what is to come.  
In the blink of an eye, she recedes into the shadows,  
leaving the Hero with a sense of quiet unease—  
a prophecy not of doom, but of truth yet to unfold.  
The weight of Thana’s words hangs over the Hero,  
a quiet reminder of the path ahead.  
It’s not long before Pandora returns covered in heavy burns and gashes.  
She pulls the rattled Hero by the arm,  
“I was ambushed.  
Whatever your problem is will have to wait.  
We have dragons to kill.”  
Together they swiftly depart the celestial refuge  
and return to the mortal plane.
</p>


<h1>An Elemental Scourge</h1>
<p>
With Aurora gone, a new war emerges on the mortal plane.  
The heavy beat of wings heralds the approach of Astratha, the Dimensional Dragon.  
She commands a vast army of dragons—elemental, primordial beings,  
their forms a perfect fusion of dragon-like appearance and raw elemental energy.  
These grand and powerful beings, her vassals,  
gather the celestial stones she needs to return to the celestial plane.
</p>

<p>
The Hero clashes against the swarming dragons,  
breaking through to Astratha.  
Her form shimmers with a bending, dimensional force,  
as she harnesses the power of the celestial stones to fuel herself.  
Astratha’s attacks distort the very fabric of reality,  
altering the air around her.  
The earth quakes under her control,  
as the land bends and twists with her every movement.  
The Hero fights with unwavering determination,  
fending off each covetous claw and breath.  
Their blade finally finding its way into Astratha’s chest,  
the Hero is able to use the box and seal Astratha once more.  
Astratha’s rampant power is contained within the box.  
She may no longer wreak havoc upon the mortal plane.
</p>


<h1>Descent into the Fiend's Abyss</h1>
<p>
The earth trembles as the Fiend's Abyss cracks open.  
A place of sulfurous stench and abandoned prayers,  
the Abyss is home to the demons that once roamed free  
before the celestial order was made.  
Not far beyond the first layer,  
a lithe figure appears bathed in a soft emerald mist.  
It is Isolde the Soulweaver, one of the seven Divine Arbiters.  
In an instant the crystal blade of the scythe in her hands  
is pressed closely against the Hero’s neck.  
As the mist thickens around the Hero,  
shrouding them from Pandora’s view,  
Isolde caresses the hero with her free hand.  
Looking doubtful, she pulls away with a disappointed sigh,  
“Are you truly capable of walking beyond the prophecy?”
</p>

<p>
Looking down on Pandora and the Hero, Isolde can’t help but laugh.  
Their weakness is palpable, pathetic even,  
and her caution dissolves into cruel amusement.  
She forces the Hero to the ground with contemptuous ease,  
her verdant nails piercing through flesh to extract their soul.  
She savours the Hero’s pain as she threads divine power deep into its core,  
engraving an agonising mark that serves as a symbol  
of the gap between the Hero and the Arbiters:  
a reminder of one’s place.
</p>

<p>
"There," she purrs,  
"In my benevolence, I have given you a piece of my strength.  
Be grateful, mortal."  
Then, with a mocking smile, she vanishes into the retreating mists.  
The Hero, now marked by Isolde’s touch, feels a surge of spirit,  
and a power that will allow them to confront the demons,  
but it is not without cost.  
This power, forced upon them,  
is a reminder of the price of this journey.
</p>


<h1>Omen of Thunder</h1>
<p>
Empowered by the soul engraving,  
the Hero steps into the dark heart of the Fiend’s Abyss to face Tyra.  
The air around the monstrous Paragon shudders  
with the violent crackle of lightning.  
The behemoth’s electrical energy spikes  
with each hit the Hero lands.  
Enraged, the cornered beast turns to face Pandora,  
discharging a beam with enough voltage to disintegrate even an immortal.  
The attack is instant,  
leaving the Hero no chance to react.
</p>

<p>
Pandora remains still as the beam dashes past erratically,  
chasing after the Celestial Hammer on the ground behind her.  
The impact is explosive, bolts flashing in all directions  
as the Hero forces their way through the chaotic storm.  
The Paragon struggles, but he is returned to the box and sealed,  
his furious energy dissipating as he is bound once more.  
The crackling ceases, replaced by a heavy stillness  
that falls over the battlefield.
