<h1>Act II – Through the Stars</h1>

<h1>The Paragon Hunt</h1>
<p>
The Hero’s journey leads them to the nexus of the Celestial Plane,  
where they encounter Kama the Love, the first true shard of Pandora’s soul.  
The Paragon stands with her bow drawn, aimed at Pandora.  
Pandora’s plan to restore her original self is no different from before,  
yet the difference is clear.  
Pandora’s eyes no longer lack the light they did before.  
Even if Pandora does not recognize it,  
Kama understands that light better than any other Paragon.  
She knows it, she trusts it, and with sorrow Kama draws her arrows against it.  
Kama does not wish to fight, but she refuses to stand aside.  
As Kama's bow snaps under the Hero's assault,  
she looks upon Pandora with a mixture of envy and understanding.  
The Hero completes the sealing, drawing Kama's essence back into the box.  
The Paragon offers no final words, only a soft smile of resigned acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Next comes Alaya, the embodiment of Pandora’s memories.  
As the Hero confronts Alaya, they are submerged in a flood of memories—  
some their own, some Pandora’s.  
The deluge comes without warning,  
threatening to drown the Hero.  
The memories rage on, relentless in their persistence,  
but the Hero stands firm.  
Each memory, each image, each thought  
is a reminder of the painful past and the hopeless path ahead.  
Eventually, the torrent subsides, leaving the Hero exhausted,  
as they tread the surface of understanding Pandora’s burden.
</p>

<p>
With each Paragon sealed,  
Pandora feels closer to reclaiming what was lost,  
but she knows this journey is not hers to walk alone.  
The Hero’s choice to aid her has placed Pandora’s redemption in their hands.  
The Hero, by their own choice, continues down this path,  
guided by the belief that this is their path to walk.
</p>


<h1>Authority of Celestia</h1>
<p>
Having witnessed the Hero's resolve,  
Pandora feels the weight of her decisions pressing on her heart once more.  
With a steady hand, she draws a thin cut across her palm,  
her cosmic blood seeping out.  
The liquid sapphire glows faintly, radiating an ethereal light.  
It is a painful gesture,  
one that signifies the transfer of something much more than power.  
Using her astral blood as the conduit,  
the boundless stars surge and cascade into the Hero’s veins,  
marking the birth of a new heir to Celestia.
</p>

<p>
This transfer, however, comes with a price.  
As the Hero absorbs her celestial essence, Pandora loses her own.  
The blood exchange, drop by drop, marks the beginning of a gradual shift.  
Her divine essence, little by little, seeps into the Hero’s soul.  
Though Pandora knows the cost, she remains resolute.  
Her burden, her essence, her fate are now entrusted to the Hero.  
A brief moment of doubt flickers within her.  
“Can you truly make us whole again?” Pandora asks,  
her voice trembling slightly.  
She feels herself becoming mortal, fragile,  
yet she has faith that the Hero, with this inherited power,  
will restore that which she cannot.
</p>


<h1>Chasing the Void</h1>
<p>
At a still vigil, a darkness descends upon the approaching Hero  
that even Alaric’s light cannot breach.  
Oblivia, the Void, breaks the silence,  
“So the new heir of Celestia wants to play the hero?  
I suppose I can give you a little attention.”  
Engulfed by emptiness, everything begins to collapse.  
“What makes you believe you can stand against erasure?  
Why must you persist?”, her commanding voice becomes aggressive,  
“Is it for Pandora? Eleuia? Thana?  
When your own future is so devoid of hope,  
just whose wishes are you carrying?”
</p>

<p>
Closing his eyes,  
the Hero draws cosmic energy from beyond the void,  
slashing open the encroaching entropy with the light of a quasar.  
Voicing their feelings the Hero says,  
“I don’t fight for Pandora, nor Eleuia, nor Thana.  
I fight for myself—to make you whole again.  
Eleuia cries because you can’t.  
Pandora suffers because you can’t.  
Your feelings aren’t your own,  
they are shared between all of you.”  
For a moment she hesitates,  
and in that moment, she is sealed.
</p>


<h1>All to Nothing</h1>
<p>
At the zenith of the Celestial Plane,  
where the fabric of the universe bends and reshapes,  
waits Akasha the Infinite.  
His golden wings glint high above the stars of the celestial skies.  
His footsteps slip through the spatial horizon, unbounded, transcending distance.  
With each gesture, the razor sharp edge of his spear  
displaces the fabric.  
In strength, in numbers, and in movement none are his match.
</p>

<p>
Akasha challenges the Hero’s growing strength.  
"Show me," he demands,  
his voice resonant like a thousand whispers,  
"Prove you can vanquish them."
</p>

<p>
In response, the Hero,  
now further along in their inheritance,  
manifests the void drawn from Oblivia’s sealed essence.  
The Hero's newfound power nullifies Akasha's infinite onslaught,  
swallowing the endless barrage of blades.  
Encircled by the clash of creation and annihilation,  
the Hero engages in hand-to-hand combat on equal footing with the Paragon—  
a test of the Hero’s right to rule the Celestia.
</p>

<p>
Channeling the full extent of his inherited power,  
the Hero imbues his blade with the radiant light of the Celestia.  
The howling dark of the void recedes,  
driven back by the light as the Hero charges forward.  
Akasha, seeing the power and conviction within them, hesitates.  
Akasha hastily flashes away,  
dropping his spear and kneeling in quiet surrender.
</p>


<h1>A Wish of Curses</h1>
<p>
Eleuia descends from above, and embraces the Hero gently.  
Her voice carries a soft, otherworldly tone, full of grace and expectation.  
"Has my blessing served you well, Child of Celestia?" she asks,  
smiling faintly, though it quickly falters.  
"Have you come to grant my wish or to end it?"  
Her gaze deepens, searching, as if weighing the Hero's intentions.  
"Or perhaps you aren’t even aware of my desire yet?"  
She pauses, her voice softening as she speaks the final thought aloud.  
"If we must fight, will you first hear my wish?"
</p>

<p>
Eleuia's crystalline tears shimmer like glass against her delicate cheeks.  
She turns her gaze downward for a moment,  
her eyes reflecting the weight of unspoken pain.  
"I am a fake," she confesses, her voice barely above a whisper.  
"A Paragon of curses.  
Have you any idea of the disparity between a wish and reality?  
A true wish is a doomed hope, one that is not meant to be."  
Her words hang heavily in the air.  
"With every passing moment,  
I shed tears for a dream I cannot reach.  
The only wishes I can still grant  
are not the ones I truly seek."  
She hesitates, her expression both vulnerable and resigned.
</p>

<p>
Eleuia lets out a slow breath,  
lifting her gaze once more to meet the Hero’s.  
"Alas, perhaps it’s not the right time  
to share such a hopeless burden with you, Hero."  
Her shoulders sag slightly, as she turns her attention to Pandora.  
"I am glad," she says,  
her voice warm but tinged with something akin to hope.  
"You seem to be doing better than when we last spoke."  
A faint smile emerging once more,  
one laced with a mixture of sorrow and pride.  
"I will trust in you—no, I will trust in myself this time,  
as it always should have been."
</p>

<p>
Eleuia steps back, her thoughts momentarily turning inward,  
a deep, sorrowful resolve settling within her.  
"I hold no sway over the Arbiters.  
But this time, it will be I who bears witness.  
Show me our wish, Pandora."
