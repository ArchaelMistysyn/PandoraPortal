<h1>Act III – Overthrow the Divine</h1>

<h1>Storming the Divine</h1>
<p>
As the celestial clouds part,  
Pandora leads the Hero into the white haven of the Divine Plane  
where the Arbiters await.  
The Hero strikes first, fighting back against the Arbiters  
to seal them within Pandora's Box.  
Avalon, Kazyth, Vexia, and Mysmir.  
One by one, they are defeated and their essences are trapped within the Box.
</p>

<p>
Isolde stands out amidst the chaos.  
Among the Arbiters, her battle prowess is rivaled only by Yubelle.  
She is a true adversary and a greater fiend than any demon.  
She draws her scythe,  
its lucent emerald hue trailing as it dances towards the Hero’s neck.  
Her strikes flow seamlessly as she weaves runes in between her slashes.  
Suddenly, her chest is pierced from behind.  
Thana extracts her pearlescent scythe, now drenched in blood,  
from Isolde’s limp chest.  
The Hero wastes no time in sealing Isolde’s essence.  
Pandora reaches out to Thana as if seeing a ghost.  
But Thana pulls away abruptly, vanishing with a brief remark,  
“Now is not the time.  
I will return swiftly.”
</p>

<p>
In the heart of the Divine Garden sits Fleur, the Oracle.  
Her presence is calm and elegant,  
yet her voice carries the heft of inevitability.  
"At last you've come for me," she says,  
her voice steady and resigned,  
as though she has waited an eternity for this moment.  
"Just as I have already foreseen your demise,  
so too have I seen my own."  
She closes her eyes,  
a shudder of acceptance passing through her as she faces her destined fate.  
"I am aware that I cannot best you," she continues,  
her voice softening.  
"But know this: Once I am gone,  
Yubelle will take from you what matters most."
</p>


<h1>Usurper’s Rise</h1>
<p>
The Hero and Pandora enter the Divine Palace,  
the grand hall bathed in an iridescent light  
from the white torches of divine flame that line the marbled path.  
The path beckons them towards the throne.
</p>

<p>
"You turn against the Arbiters?  
You seek to steal from God?  
You defy the Divine Lotus?"  
Yubelle’s voice echoes,  
a powerful declaration of judgment reverberating through the Divine Plane.  
"I name your crimes: Subversion.  
Betrayal.  
Theft.  
Heresy.  
Sacrilege.  
And now, I grant you judgment for your sins."
</p>

<p>
Yubelle, once the Arbiter meant to serve the Sacred will,  
has fallen into corruption.  
She is no longer simply a figure of divine justice.  
She has become a living embodiment of the Divine Lotus’s power—  
its dark, twisted reflection.  
With her ascent, Yubelle has fused with the Lotus,  
her form becoming a monstrous abomination  
as the energy of the Divine Plane surges within her.  
The air around her tall and armored body fades to gray,  
becoming colder and more colorless than the void.  
All that remains is the scintillating purple lightning  
emanating from her blade.  
The large sword pulses with chaotic energy,  
casting a wicked light upon the throne.
</p>

<p>
The Hero, unprepared for the full extent of Yubelle's divine might,  
is swiftly overpowered.  
Pandora stands bare and mortal before the Hero,  
as she feels the last remnants of her celestial authority  
flicker away into nothing.  
Her once-glowing form begins to fall apart,  
as Yubelle’s assimilation progresses, she evaporates slowly.  
In her final moments she calls out to the Hero,  
"You have chosen your path, my Hero."  
Her voice breaks down along with her body,  
as she crumbles to dust, like ash in the wind.
</p>

<p>
In that moment, Thana’s intervention is the only thing that saves the Hero.  
With a sudden pull, she drags them into the Samsara—  
a realm beyond time and space,  
where the laws of the universe bend and break.  
There, the Hero finds themselves staring up  
into Thana’s sharp, cold eyes.  
"You think you can walk away unscathed?" she asks,  
her voice tinged with anger.  
"My sister’s death… it’s on your hands."  
But even through her fury, there is a flicker of something else—  
a sliver of hope.  
Thana’s voice softens slightly.  
"So called Hero, will you still endeavor to fulfill a now meaningless promise?”  
Thana reconstructs the Hero’s broken bones and wounded flesh.  
“Death is my domain.  
So long as your essence does not break,  
I will find you, I will repair you,  
I will send you to fight once more.  
I believe in my sister, so I will believe in you.  
Hero, you are no less immortal than your enemy.”
</p>


<h1>Birth of Nephilim</h1>
<p>
Yubelle’s transformation reaches its apex.  
She seizes control and fully merges with the core of the Divine Lotus,  
encysting and forming a translucent golden chrysalis.  
Her form grows, twisting within the sacred womb,  
becoming a massive, monstrous being—Nephilim,  
a creature of unimaginable power.
</p>

<p>
Upon Emergence, the shell breaks away and Nephilim is born.  
But Nephilim is sluggish, her movements slow and awkward,  
her body struggling to take on the overwhelming power it now holds.  
With each blow the Hero delivers,  
Nephilim’s still unstable form fractures and reforms,  
a continuous cycle of death and rebirth.  
The Lotus throbs with vitality,  
its tendrils reaching out to mend the cracks.  
The Hero cannot destroy her  
for Nephilim is an embodiment of divinity itself.
</p>

<p>
The battle feels endless,  
a contest between the Hero’s will and Nephilim’s ceaseless resurrection.  
At first, Nephilim's control over her newfound power is incomplete,  
and she staggers in the wake of her transformation.  
But with each cycle, she grows stronger,  
her attacks more devastating, her form less fragile.  
The Hero, though resolute, can only delay her,  
sealing her away as a temporary reprieve.
</p>


<h1>A Heartfelt Wish</h1>
<p>
With the final battle drawing near,  
the Hero manifests Eleuia’s soul from the Box.  
An ethereal echo of herself, once sealed away,  
now shines brilliantly, standing before the Hero.  
“You’ve come so far,” Eleuia’s proud voice fills with a deep sorrow,  
“But your victories are hollow.  
You’ve gathered all of our shards,  
only to lose the key that holds them together.  
You’ve sealed Nephilim,  
but they continue to break free, stronger each time.  
Has your wish come true?  
What will you do now?”  
A small pause, her expression shifting as she speaks again, more quietly.  
“Perhaps in that little box, you can finally find peace.”
</p>

<p>
Sensing the Hero’s intent she steps closer,  
her voice gaining a sharp edge,  
“Are you not satisfied?  
How long can you keep fighting before you are overwhelmed?  
Don’t you understand what will happen if you set it free?  
If you aren’t there to hold it back, what then?  
Knowing all of this, you would still chase after your own demise?”  
Eleuia sighs, her shoulders sagging with a bittersweet acceptance.  
“If you must,” she continues, her voice softer now,  
“then I suppose it’s time to entrust you with my wish…  
our wish… Pandora’s wish.”
</p>

<p>
She looks at the Hero, her eyes bubbling with vulnerability,  
a final plea.  
“Please… save us all.”
</p>


<h1>Inevitable Destination</h1>
<p>
The Hero, no stronger than before, stands ready,  
empowered only in spirit by Pandora’s wish.  
Releasing the seal, the Hero confronts Nephilim once again.  
The Divine Lotus trembles,  
its form cracking as the Hero breaks through Nephilim’s defenses.  
Crushing the incarnate relentlessly,  
faster than it can fully regenerate.
</p>

<p>
The Divine Lotus, unable to withstand the relentless onslaught, collapses.  
Nephilim’s monstrous form dissolves,  
leaving behind only Yubelle’s spent smile  
as Thana leads the dust of her soul  
to find its way back into the ever-flowing Samsara.
</p>

<p>
As the Lotus reaches its limit and falls into ruin,  
Thana’s prophecy comes to fruition.  
The final act of the Divine Lotus fades into a quiet resolution,  
as the Hero embarks anew in search of distant stars,  
hoping to one day see Pandora smile.
